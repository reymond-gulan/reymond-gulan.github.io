            Hi, I am <span class="emphasize uppercase">Reymond Gulan</span>, a graduate of 
            Bachelor of Science in Information Systems and soon to be a

            <p>
                <br />
                I started doing programming professionally in 2018 where I landed my first 
                solo project for a local junior high school institution.
                In my almost <span id="total-experience"></span> years of commercial experience 
                working with local and foreign companies, with expertise in Web Development, 
                I have proven my skills in building robust and scalable web applications, 
                working with APIs, creating unit testing, 
                and ensuring product quality, particularly using Laravel, that adheres 
                with the industry's best practices and coding standards.
                <br /><br />
                My strengths lie in debugging complex issues, 
                ensuring software reliability through thorough and extensive testing, 
                and maintaining high standards of quality 
                throughout the development process. My pride and passion in terms of 
                interpersonal and professional development always drive me to learn new 
                technologies, stay abreast of the latest trends, and best practices in the industry. 
                With a strong focus on problem-solving, keen eye for detail, and a commitment to continuous improvement, 
                I'm excited to contribute to innovative projects and take on new challenges in the world of web development.
